## About

This middleware ensures that a user is logged in.  If a request is received that
is unauthenticated, the request will be redirected to a login page.  The URL
will be saved in the session, so the user can be conveniently returned to the
page that was originally requested.

## Install

```
$ npm install @passport-next/connect-ensure-login
```
